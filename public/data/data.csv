The Arabian oryx, also known as the white oryx, is a medium-sized antelope species native to the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula. 

Historically, the Arabian oryx was widely hunted for its meat, skin, and horns, which were used for traditional medicines and decoration. By the 1960s, the population of Arabian oryx had declined to just a few individuals, and it was declared extinct in the wild. 

However, thanks to conservation efforts, the Arabian oryx population has made a remarkable recovery. In 1982, the UAE began a captive breeding program, and in 2011, the Arabian oryx was re-introduced into the wild. As of 2021, the wild population of Arabian oryx has reached over 1,000 individuals, making it a conservation success story.

Arabian oryxes are well adapted to the harsh desert environment. They have white coats that reflect sunlight and can regulate their body temperatures through their large ears. They are also able to go for long periods of time without water, relying on the moisture they obtain from the plants they eat.

In the UAE, the Arabian oryx is a national symbol of conservation and resilience. It is even featured on the country's coat of arms.
