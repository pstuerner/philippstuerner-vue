                        Some things in life are important, such as giving your parents a call from time to time, brushing
                        your teeth,
                        drinking enough water or making sure not to forget your fiancé's birthday. The list of important
                        things is of
                        course much longer and depends on the individual, but I'm pretty sure that gradient descent should
                        be on
                        everyone's list. Why? Because the world is full of problems that revolve around finding an optimal
                        solution and
                        gradient descent, which is a generic optimization algorithm, is capable of finding these solutions!
                        It is such
                        an important algorithm that many people assume that it must be really complicated. Spoiler alert:
                        it's not 🙏.

                    <p>
                        I was really looking forward to this set of interactive D3.js charts since gradient descent is just
                        perfect to
                        visualize and so easy to understand as soon as you actually see what's going on. The following
                        sections will
                        lead you through
                        the entire algorithm and show you what's happening under the hood. I'll start with an extremely
                        simple example
                        to set the scene and let you know what gradient descent even is, what it's used for and what the
                        general idea
                        behind the algorithm is. Afterwards, we'll extend the first example to find out how gradient descent
                        works when
                        the underlying problem becomes more complex. Finally, we'll also explore what gradient descent's
                        pitfalls are
                        and learn more about further variations to tackle these obstacles. In the final section we are going
                        to recap on
                        all different gradient descent variations we've seen so far and compare them. Sounds alright 😎? Go
                        ahead, check
                        the table of contents and start exploring the first section.

                    <p>
                        Some machine learning methods sound catchy, but you have absolutely no idea what they do after you
                        first hear
                        about them. I mean, why should I care about a random forest and what am I supposed to do with a
                        ridge or a
                        lasso?
                        On the other hand, there are some methods for which the name itself already answers all the
                        questions. If you
                        ask me, gradient descent belongs to the latter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's because gradient descent is about descending something called the gradient. Nothing more,
                        nothing less.
                        The most intuitive way to think about the gradient is by imagining a single-variable function such
                        as
                        \(y=f(x)\). In that case, the gradient simply refers to the rate of change, meaning the derivative
                        \(\frac{\partial}{\partial{x}}f(x)\), which is the same as the slope. Although this is a nice way to
                        introduce
                        what a gradient is, it doesn't entirely fulfill its definition. The reason for this is that the
                        slope is a
                        scalar, while the gradient always represents vector. More precisely, the gradient of a function
                        \(f\), denoted
                        as \(\nabla f\), is the collection of all its partial derivatives into a vector. Hence, the gradient
                        vector of a
                        multi-variable function such as \(y=f(x,y)\) looks like the following: $$\nabla
                        f=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x}}f(x,y)\\\frac{\partial}{\partial{y}}f(x,y)\end{pmatrix}$$
                        Good to know, but ... why is this actually useful? And how does it relate to machine learning and
                        solving
                        optimization problems? Well, the nice thing about the gradient is that <b>it points into the
                            direction of
                            steepest ascent</b> for any given input \((x,y)\). This is really powerful since often times the
                        main job of
                        a machine learning algorithm is to find a set of parameters that minimizes a cost function. Now, we
                        could
                        brute-force our way through all possible combinations and search for years. Or we use gradient
                        descent to find
                        the steepest ascent of the loss function in order to intelligently determine the next set of
                        parameters.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let me summarize the introduction: the main idea behind gradient descent is to iteratively change a
                        set
                        of model parameters to minimize a cost function. This is done by calculating the local gradient of
                        the cost
                        function with respect to each model parameter and going in the direction of the descending gradient.
                        Once the
                        gradient is zero (or really close to zero), you have reached an optimum! Let's find out how gradient
                        descent
                        looks like from a visual viewpoint by examining a really simple regression problem.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">A Really Simple Example</h2>
                    <p>
                        Let’s work on a dead simple regression problem including one explanatory variable \(X\) and one
                        dependent
                        variable \(y\). Our goal is to find a linear model that describes the underlying data best and can
                        be used for
                        future predictions. If you’re not familiar with linear models yet make sure to read through <a
                            href="#" target="_blank">one of my other dashboards</a> that covers all kinds of linear models
                        in greater detail. The
                        following interactive chart should give you an idea about what kind of problem we’re dealing with
                        and which
                        assumptions I took to simplify this example as much as possible.

                        As you can see, our problem is limited to finding the best possible \(\theta_1\) parameter. This is
                        because I
                        have already calculated the best possible \(\theta_0\) parameter and set it for the entire example.
                        The reason
                        for this is that it allows me to plot the gradient and the cost function in a 2D scatter plot, which
                        really
                        helps to understand how gradient descent works step by step. So don't worry about \(\theta_0\) for
                        now, we will
                        talk
                        about how to use gradient descent to optimize multiple parameters later.

                        Your current parameter values are <a class="chart1-bslider"></a> and <a class="chart1-mslider"></a>
                        which gives
                        us a MSE of <a class="chart1-mse-short"></a>. If you click the "Best fit" button, you will see what
                        our final
                        result should look like. There
                        are several ways to figure out which value for \(\theta_1\) gives the best fitting line and gradient
                        descent is
                        one of them. As we already know from above, there are two special ingredients we need before we can
                        get started:
                        the cost function and its gradient.

                    <p>
                        There are a variety of cost functions, but we will stick to the mean squared error (MSE) since it is
                        simple,
                        convex, and differentiable. This is what the equation for MSE looks like:

                        Nothing too complicated for now 👍. \(m\) defines the numer of instances in the training dataset,
                        \(y^{i}\) is
                        the ground
                        truth for the \(i\)th instance, \(\theta^{T}\) is the transpose of the parameter vector, \(x^{i}\)
                        is the
                        feature vector of the \(i\)th instance and both combined (\(\theta^{T}x^{i}\)) is our current
                        prediction for the
                        \(i\)th instance. In a nutshell: take the prediction error for each instance, square it, sum all of
                        them and
                        take the mean. However, there is a small modification that will make our lives a little easier, and
                        that is to
                        multiply the entire equation by \(\frac{1}{2}\): $$ \textrm{MSE}(\theta) =
                        \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}{(\theta^{T}x^{i}-y^{i})^2} $$ The reason for this is that it makes the
                        math, in our
                        case the derivative of the cost function with respect to each model parameter, easier to handle.
                        Fortunately,
                        our simple example contains only one model parameter, which means that the gradient and the slope of
                        the cost
                        function are exactly the same. The derivative of MSE with respect to \(\theta_1\) looks like this:
                    </p>
                    <p style="overflow-x: auto;">
                        $$
                        \frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta_1}}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\theta^{T}x^{i}-y^{i})x_{1}^{i}
                        $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see, the previously added \(\frac{1}{2}\) cancels out due to the power rule applied to
                        \((\theta^Tx^i-y^i)^2\). So adding \(\frac{1}{2}\) is just for convenience and makes the derivation
                        look
                        prettier. It doesn't matter for the result because the minimization is unaffected by constants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We are almost done and there are only two more things to mention before you can explore gradient
                        descent step by
                        step. The first is to tell gradient descent where to start, i.e. which parameter we use first to
                        evaluate the
                        slope of the cost function. The solution is simple: just take a random guess. Start anywhere and
                        gradient
                        descent will figure out which direction to go.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last missing ingredient is the so-called learning rate \(\eta\). It is certainly one of the most
                        important
                        parameters, as it determines the size of the steps that gradient descent takes at each iteration.
                        For the
                        learning rate, neither too large nor too small is the correct solution. If the learning rate is too
                        small,
                        gradient descent will require many iterations and significantly more time to reach the optimal
                        solution. If the
                        learning rate is too large, then gradient descent may even overshoot and move away from the optimal
                        solution,
                        meaning that the algorithm will not converge. So the sweet spot is in the middle: small enough for
                        guaranteed
                        convergence, large enough for as few iterations as possible.

                        That's it ✨! Now you have everything in your toolbox that you need to understand the following
                        interactive
                        D3.js chart. Everything should be pretty straightforward. The left chart contains the actual problem
                        including
                        the scatter data and the regression line based on the current \(\theta_1\) value. The right chart
                        gives insights
                        into the gradient, as it displays the resulting loss for a range of \(\theta_1\) values. Play around
                        with the
                        \(\eta\) and \(\theta_1^\textrm{init}\) parameters to get a feeling about what effect different
                        learning rates
                        and starting values have on the optimization process. You can either use the play, pause, and stop
                        buttons on
                        the bottom of the chart or use the slider to have more control over each single step.

                        The first thing we see is that gradient descent is an iterative process. We start somewhere far away
                        and
                        approach the optimal solution with each subsequent step. This is done by iteratively setting and
                        updating
                        \(\theta_1\) based on the value of the gradient and the learning rate. Let's cover four of the most
                        common
                        scenarios to give you a better intuition for the learning rate. Also make sure to click the bullet
                        point's play

                            is convex
                            and the learning rate is small enough. That is, as you decrease the learning rate, the time to
                            convergence
                            also increases, since each update is just a baby step. Expect some waiting time if your random
                            initialization is far from the optimal solution and the learning rate is too low.

                        Great! This is what simple one-parameter gradient descent looks like from a visual point of view.
                        Not so
                        complicated when you visualize each step and see how gradient descent finds its way to the valley,
                        right? Let's
                        build on what we've just learnt and extend the previous example to make it a little more complex.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">A Less Simple Example</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most real examples deal with more than one parameter, so we will abandon this assumption. In the
                        following
                        example we will try to find the optimal solution by finding the line with the best slope <b>and</b>
                        intercept.
                        The following D3.js chart should once again give you an idea of the type of problem we are dealing
                        with and
                        which best fitting line we're looking for.

                        I am aware that most real-life cases also deal with more than two parameters, but for gradient
                        descent it makes
                        no difference whether you have two or a hundred model parameters. This is because the underlying
                        concept remains
                        the same and only the computational complexity increases. Let's find out what gradient descent looks
                        like with
                        two parameters and what changes from the previous example.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We still have our MSE cost function:
                    </p>
                    <p style="overflow-x: auto;">
                        $$ \textrm{MSE}(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}{(\theta^Tx^i-y^i)^2},
                        \: \textrm{with} \: \theta=\begin{pmatrix}\theta_0\\\theta_1\end{pmatrix} $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The only difference is that we
                        loosen our assumption about a fixed \(\theta_0\) value and treat it as a real model parameter.
                        Pretty much the
                        same way we treated \(\theta_1\) in the previous example. Here is the first difference: since we
                        need to
                        calculate the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to each model parameter, we have
                        an
                        additional equation:
                    </p>
                    <p style="overflow-x: auto;">
                        $$
                        \frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta_0}}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\theta^{T}x^{i}-y^{i})x_{0}^{i}
                        $$
                        $$
                        \frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta_1}}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\theta^{T}x^{i}-y^{i})x_{1}^{i}
                        $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike the first example we are now dealing with two parameters, which is why we cannot further
                        oversimplify the
                        gradient as the slope of the loss function. However, everything else remains the same. We take a
                        random guess
                        for the initialization of \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\), measure the local gradient of the cost
                        function with
                        respect to each model parameter, and update the parameters based on the learning rate. In this way,
                        we slowly
                        move towards the descending gradient.

                        After clicking the play button gradient descent approaches the optimal solution step by step. The
                        only
                        difference to the previous example is that gradient descent updates both the intercept and the slope
                        with each
                        successive iteration. But wait 😱, what the hell happened to our bowl-shaped looking cost function
                        chart on the
                        right? Suddenly we're seeing a fancy three dimensional surface and everything looks a lot more
                        complicated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fortunately, it's not really more complicated. In the previous example, we took care of one
                        parameter while
                        paying attention
                        to the cost function. Now we take care of two parameters while paying attention to the cost
                        function. That's a
                        total of three axes, which is why we're working in 3D rather than 2D space. Also, with two
                        parameters, our cost
                        function becomes a surface, since the MSE depends on both \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\). The same
                        thing happens
                        with our gradient. In the previous example, our gradient was a simple line defined only by the slope
                        of the cost
                        function. Now the gradient is a tangent plane that touches the surface of the cost function at
                        \((\theta_0,
                        \theta_1)\).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With regard to the learning rate, all of the four previously mentioned scenarios also apply in this
                        case, which
                        means that the learning rate should be neither too large nor too small. In the following two
                        scenarios, we will
                        see that besides the learning rate, the scaling of the input features also plays a crucial role.

                            already decreased to 0.56.

                    <p>
                        As you can see, mean normalization changes the shape of the loss surface. In the unnormalized case
                        the loss
                        function can have a higher curvature, which eventually will require gradient descent to take more
                        steps to
                        converge. Normalizing the input features allows us to avoid error functions shaped like elongated
                        bowls and
                        rather turn them into nicely spherical looking objects. Don't worry, the entire concept is a lot
                        easier to
                        understand when looking at a so-called contour chart, which we'll do in the final D3.js chart of
                        this post. Just
                        try to remember that without prior scaling the path to the optimal solution is often complicated and
                        cornered.
                        However, after prior scaling gradient descent usually follows a straight line to the best possible
                        solution and
                        converges much faster.

                        along the way. To be precise, we have dealt
                        with the most general variant, namely batch gradient descent. In the previous examples we could see
                        that batch
                        gradient descent is an excellent tool to solve optimization problems, however the algorithm also has
                        some
                        weaknesses. In the next section we will deal with the pitfalls of batch gradient descent and some
                        possible
                        alternatives.

                    <p>
                        So what is wrong with batch gradient descent? You have surely noticed that each additional model
                        parameter
                        results in another partial derivative of the cost function. For a model with three parameters, for
                        example, the
                        following situation would emerge:
                    </p>
                    <p style="overflow-x: auto;">
                        $$ \textrm{MSE}(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}{(\theta^Tx^i-y^i)^2}, \:
                        \textrm{with} \: \theta=\begin{pmatrix}\theta_0\\\theta_1\\\theta_2\end{pmatrix} $$ $$
                        \frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta_0}}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\theta^{T}x^{i}-y^{i})x_{0}^{i}

                        \frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta_1}}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\theta^{T}x^{i}-y^{i})x_{1}^{i}
                        $$ $$
                        \frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta_2}}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\theta^{T}x^{i}-y^{i})x_{2}^{i}

                        Cumbersome 🤢! However, this is not a problem, because it is not necessary to determine the gradient
                        by
                        individual evaluation of the partial derivatives. It is far more convenient to compute the gradient
                        vector \(\nabla_{\theta}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)\) in order to come up with all partial derivatives in
                        one go. The
                        determination of the gradient vector is more complicated and outside the scope of this post. In case
                        you are
                        curious about it, I recommend this answer on <a

                        looks like
                        this:

                        $$
                        \nabla_{\theta}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta_0}}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)\\\frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta_1}}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)\\\vdots\\\frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta_n}}\textrm{MSE}(\theta)\end{pmatrix}=\frac{1}{m}X^T(X\theta-y)

                        This is a neat trick and can save you some work. The following minimal example shows that the
                        gradient vector
                        leads to the same result as the more time-consuming way of evaluating the partial derivatives one by
                        one. Pay
                        attention to how <code>gradients_manual</code> and <code>gradients_nabla</code> are calculated in
                        two different
                        ways but end up having the same result.

                        Although the gradient vector is an enormous improvement, it does not solve the root of the problem:
                        \(X\). The
                        reason is that each gradient descent step requires evaluating the <strong>entire</strong> training
                        dataset
                        \(X\). This means that batch gradient descent becomes terribly slow on very large datasets.
                        Interestingly,
                        however, gradient descent scales very well when the number of features explodes (e.g. several
                        hundred thousand)
                        and performs significantly better than, for example, the normal equation. Luckily, batch gradient
                        descent is
                        just the beginning and there are plenty of variations that improve computational limitations. In
                        general there
                        are two main variations, namely
                        stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent, which prevent the need to use the
                        entire training
                        dataset at each step to calculate the gradient.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Stochastic Gradient Descent</h2>
                    <p>
                        Unlike batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent uses a random instance in the training
                        data set to
                        calculate the gradient. So you could say that stochastic gradient descent is the extreme
                        counterexample to batch
                        gradient descent. The former uses the minimum number of instances, while the latter uses the largest
                        possible
                        number of instances. The advantage is obvious: stochastic gradient descent is fast. Regardless of
                        the size of
                        the data set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the risk of getting stuck in a local optimum is lower. Not all cost functions are
                        convex and
                        perfectly bowl-shaped. Depending on the problem, a cost function may consist of multiple local
                        minima and
                        plateaus, making the approximation either more difficult or the result misleading. Stochastic
                        gradient descent
                        has the advantage that because of the built-in randomness, the algorithm does not take a direct path
                        to the
                        optimum, but rather jumps back and forth on the cost function. Thus, there is the possibility that
                        stochastic
                        gradient descent moves away from a local optimum to find the global one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The disadvantage is that the algorithm will arrive somewhere near the optimum but won't settle there
                        for
                        certain. Since one random instance is used to determine the gradient per step, stochastic gradient
                        descent jumps
                        around the best solution even near the optimum. This means that the final parameters are good, but
                        not optimal.
                        One way to improve the convergence to the optimal solution is to gradually reduce the learning rate.
                        This
                        approach is referred to as the learning schedule and simply means that the algorithm takes large
                        steps as long
                        as it is far and small steps as soon as it is close to the optimum.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Mini-batch Gradient Descent</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now that you know batch and stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent is not
                        difficult to
                        explain. Basically, it is a middle way of the two gradient descent variations already explained.
                        Again, the
                        number
                        of training instances used to determine the gradient is important. Mini-batch gradient descent works
                        with
                        so-called mini-batches and therefore uses more instances than stochastic but less than batch
                        gradient descent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similar to stochastic gradient descent, the used instances are randomly selected. Depending on the
                        batch size,
                        mini-batch gradient descent can be either really similar to stochastic gradient descent (small
                        batches) or batch
                        gradient descent (large batches). The biggest advantage over stochastic gradient descent is that the
                        performance
                        of the algorithm can be improved by hardware optimization (e.g. faster matrix operations by using
                        GPUs).
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="section-heading">Gradient Descent Comparison</h1>
                    <p>
                        It's time to compare batch (BGD), stochastic (SGD) and mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD) to get a
                        sense of how
                        they perform next to each other. As in the previous examples I've constructed a linear regression
                        problem with
                        one dependent variable and one explanatory
                        variable (plus the bias term, hence two parameters to optimize). The underlying data as well as the
                        current
                        regression model for each gradient descent step are shown in the left graph. If you're bored of the
                        current
                        dataset feel free to click the "New data" button, which will give you a brand new linear dataset
                        with some
                        additional noise. Pay attention: since we are comparing three different algorithms, each additional
                        step results
                        in three different regression lines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the right hand chart we see the cost function as a contour plot for different \(\theta_0,
                        \theta_1\) values.
                        A contour plot allows us to plot three dimension in a two dimensional coordinate system by
                        visualizing one of
                        the dimensions using thresholds and/or colors. In this case, bright regions include parameter
                        combinations
                        resulting in low MSE losses, while darker regions contain \(\theta\) values with a high MSE loss.
                        The starting
                        point (\(\theta_0^{\textrm{init}}\) ,\(\theta_1^{\textrm{init}}\)) is randomly chosen and the same
                        for all three
                        algorithms. As soon as you click the "Play" button you'll see how all three gradient descent
                        variations strive
                        for the best possible parameter combination.

                                    At what point should gradient descent stop iterating? There are multiple solutions to
                                    this question,
                                    for example:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Maximum iterations: set a fixed number of steps</li>
                                        <li>Absolute tolerance: define when the loss is "close enough" to zero (assumes that
                                            you're
                                            expecting a zero)</li>
                                        <li>Relative tolerance: define an improvement threshold and stop as soon as you drop
                                            below it

                                    You should adjust the learning rate for stochastic and mini-batch gradient
                                    descent unless you want them to jump around the optimum for a long time. Adaptive
                                    learning rates are
                                    a topic on their own and way too extensive for one bullet point. If you're just
                                    experimenting start
                                    with a simple learning schedule like time or drop-based. If you want to improve the
                                    learning rate
                                    dilemma have a look at momentum or the Nesterov accelerated gradient.

                                    As mentioned before, mean normalization is a powerful preprocessing
                                    technique for gradient descent. When normalizing the dataset you can recognize that the
                                    loss contour
                                    turns into a more spherically shaped area. This makes it easier for gradient descent to
                                    converge and
                                    also avoids the already mentioned jumpy behavior of stochastic and mini-batch gradient
                                    descent when
                                    the underlying dataset has more noise.

                        That's it 🔥! That was an intense post so kudos if you made it this far. I had actually planned to
                        do a very
                        short and crisp post on gradient descent, but quickly realized that the algorithm and applications
                        are too
                        versatile and a more detailed elaboration is needed. I hope the examples and math notations helped
                        you to get a
                        better overview of gradient descent. The comparison section is, in my opinion, a fun way to
                        illustrate
                        differences in the three algorithms and to show how different alternatives affect the final path. As
                        always,
                        feel free to <a href="mailto:philipp.stuerner@web.de">reach out</a> if you have any questions, the
                        examples are
                        confusing, or you spot an error."
