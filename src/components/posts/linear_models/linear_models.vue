                    <p><b>tl;dr:</b> although linear models are by far no rocket science they can be incredibly powerful.
                        I've written a
                        couple of D3.js charts that will help you to interactively understand how linear and logistic
                        regression work,
                        what polynomial features are, and why overfitting is so dangerous. You can find the source code on

                    <p>
                        Linear models were probably my first exposure to machine learning, though at that time I didn't
                        really know what
                        machine learning even is. I remember a lecture on econometrics in which we predicted a country's
                        gross domestic
                        product (GDP) using a linear regression. The professor couldn't really sell the topic in a sexy way,
                        so I wasn't
                        very enthusiastic about putting a straight line through a scatter plot and declared the lecture as
                        utterly
                        boring 😕. Today, I believe that linear models are among the most beautiful flavors in machine
                        learning.
                        Compared to other machine learning algorithms, linear models are very simple. This has the advantage
                        that you
                        can always reconstruct how the final prediction was made. However, linear models should not be
                        underestimated,
                        as they are incredibly versatile and can solve a wide range of problems.

                        In the following, we first deal with the simplest form of a linear model, namely an univariate
                        linear
                        regression. We then find out how to model nonlinear relationships by including polynomial features
                        into the
                        linear regression model. Furthermore, we see from the discrepancy between train and test errors that
                        polynomial
                        regressions and their degrees of freedom are a great extension, but should be used with caution.
                        Finally, we
                        find out that linear models are not only useful for solving regression but also classification
                        problems. Let's
                        get right to it.

                    <p>
                        Univariate linear regression involves modeling or predicting the numerical value of one variable
                        based on the
                        data of another variable. What will be the gross domestic product in the next year if the production
                        numbers
                        remain the same? What is the weight of this person at a height of 1.80m? Do people who spend more
                        time on social
                        media generally feel more insecure? If we try to explain the result of a dependent variable (GDP,
                        weight,
                        feeling of insecurity) on the basis of an explanatory variable (production numbers, height, time
                        spent on social
                        media) we are dealing with a univariate linear regression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The heart of a (univariate) linear regression is the following equation: $$\hat{y}=\theta^{T}X$$ For
                        which
                        \(\hat{y}\) is the predicted value of the dependent variable (e.g. GDP). \(\theta\) is the model's
                        parameter
                        vector, which, in the univariate case, consist of the bias term \(\theta_0\) and the weight of the
                        explanatory
                        variable \(\theta_1\) (e.g. production numbers). \(X\) is the model's design matrix, which includes
                        all
                        explanatory variables. Remember that to properly embed the bias term you have to make sure that the
                        first column
                        of the design matrix is made up of ones. Now, the thing is, this is much easier to understand when
                        you can
                        visually see what's going on and manipulate the parameters yourself. Feel free to play around with
                        the
                        \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\) sliders in the D3.js chart below. Watch how the line moves and repeat
                        the process
                        with different datasets. If you want to know what the perfect line for the underlying dataset looks
                        like click
                        on the "Best fit" button. If you're bored of the current dataset just create a new one by clicking
                        on "New
                        data". Ignore the residuals slider and metrics for now, we'll get to them in a moment.

                        As you can see, \(\theta_0\) simply changes the vertical positioning, while \(\theta_1\) changes the
                        slope of
                        the line. But how to find the line that best approximates the scatter plot? The answer is to find
                        the line to
                        which the distance to all points is the smallest. This can be achieved by using different cost
                        functions that
                        quantify the fit of a line. Among the most common cost functions are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>

                                \textrm{MSE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2} $$

                                from the line $$ \textrm{RMSE}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2}} $$
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <b>Mean Absolute Error:</b> The mean absolute deviation of all true \(y\) values from the
                                line $$
                                \textrm{MAE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\left| y_i-\hat{y}_i \right|} $$
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        At this point the residuals slider provides a suitable visualization. As soon as you activate the
                        slider you see
                        the distance between each true \(y\) value and the line. This deviation is also called residual. If
                        you change
                        \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\), the residuals grow and shrink, respectively, and the resulting cost
                        functions
                        improve or become worse. You can observe that after you press the "Best fit" button the residuals
                        are as small
                        as possible and MSE, RMSE and MAE take their best possible values. Any further changes to the
                        \(\theta_0\) and
                        \(\theta_1\) sliders will increase the residuals and worsen the fit of the line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast to MSE, RMSE and MAE, it is not true for \(\textrm{R}^2\) that smaller values are
                        better.
                        \(\textrm{R}^2\) describes which part of the variance is described by the model. R-squared is
                        therefore a value
                        between 0 and 1 for which larger values are better. Thus, an \(\textrm{R}^2\) value of 1 means that
                        the model
                        can perfectly explain the data. Very high \(\textrm{R}^2\) values should be viewed skeptically, as
                        they are an
                        indication of overfitting, which will be discussed in more detail later. Don't be surprised if
                        \(\textrm{R}^2\)
                        takes a negative value in one of the following charts. \(\textrm{R}^2 &lt; 0\) doesn't indicate that
                        the model is
                        wrong, but rather that the model is extremely poor. This is because a negative \(\textrm{R}^2\)
                        implies that
                        the model is not capable of explaining more variance than a horizontal line. </p>
                    <p>
                        For above's dataset, the best possible line is obtained with <span class="chart1-mathjax">\({{ theta0_best }}\)</span> and
                        <span class="chart1-mathjax">\({{ theta1_best }}\)</span>. There are several ways to determine these values. Probably one of
                        the
                        most common approaches is gradient descent, which is a generic optimization algorithm that is the
                        best
                        choice for solving a variety of problems. However, gradient descent is quite extensive and I thought
                        that it's best to explain the algorithm in an entire post. If you're not familiar with gradient
                        descent
                        yet make sure to have a look <a href="https://web.philippstuerner.com/posts/gradient_descent"
                            target="_blank">here</a>. Luckily, for some problems, gradient descent is not the only way to
                        find
                        the optimal solution. Let me introduce an alternative approach of finding the best possible set of
                        parameters: the normal equation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The normal equation, unlike gradient descent, which is an iterative process, determines the best
                        possible model parameters using a mathematical equation: $$ \hat{\theta} = (X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y $$
                        For
                        which \(\hat{\theta}\) is the value of \(\theta\) that minimizes the cost function, \(X\) is a
                        matrix
                        containing all values of the descriptive variable, and \(y\) is a vector containing the dependent
                        variable. The normal equation is a so-called closed-form solution, which is an amazing concept,
                        since
                        \(X\), \(y\) and some algebra is all we need to find the best possible model parameters
                        \(\hat{\theta}\). Calculating \(\hat{\theta}\) by hand looks like this:
                    </p>
                    <p id='normal-equation' style="overflow-x: auto;"></p>
                    <p>
                        😨 no one has time for that. Plus, all the computational steps (transposing, inverting, multiplying)
                        are
                        tedious and error-prone. This is why, instead, we let Python do the hard work for us. Here is the
                        same
                        calculation as above, only much faster since we use Numpy:

                    <p>
                        Both, the code example and the matrix notation, are dynamic and adapt to the dataset displayed in
                        the
                        D3.js chart above 😎. Give it a try: click on the "New data" button below and you should see that
                        the
                        computations of the matrix and numpy notations change. The resulting \(\hat{\theta}\) values should
                        be
                        the same. You can check if everything is correct by returning to the D3.js chart above. Click the
                        "Best
                        fit" button and check if the values for the \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\) sliders match the results.

                        In general, that's all you need to know about univariate linear regression. For the multivariate
                        case,
                        that is, when multiple explanatory variables enter the equation, the approach is very similar. In
                        the
                        next section you will see that although the equations and matrices are larger and more
                        comprehensive,
                        the underlying procedure is the same.

                        The above is all nice and great, but there's one big problem that you've probably already noticed.
                        Every
                        time you click on "New dataset" in the chart above, scikit-learn's <a
                            href="https://scikit-learn.org/0.16/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_regression.html#sklearn.datasets.make_regression"
                            target="_blank"><code>make_regression</code></a> function creates a new dataset with a clear
                        linear
                        relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables. I do this on purpose because linear
                        regression is a high bias model, which means that certain conditions must apply to the dataset.
                        Unfortunately, not all relationships in life are linear, which is why you cannot simpy throw a
                        linear
                        regression on everything. So does this mean that linear regression is only applicable if the
                        underlying
                        dataset also has a linear structure 😢? No, it does not! At this point I'd like to introduce
                        polynomial
                        features, as they allow us to model a non-linear relationship in a linear way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A polynomial feature is nothing more than an additional feature created from an existing feature.
                        Let's
                        say we have a dataset that has the shape of a parabola. It makes no sense to model the dataset using
                        a
                        simple linear regression. This is because the relationship is not linear but quadratic. To improve
                        the
                        fit of our line we extend the model by a polynomial feature which is just the squared value of our
                        already existing feature. An additional feature means there is a further model parameter
                        \(\theta_2\)
                        which we'll have to optimize. As before, we need nothing more than the normal equation to determine
                        the
                        best possible parameters \(\theta_0\), \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). This is because \(\hat{\theta}
                        =
                        (X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y\) works with one, ten or hundred features — it makes no difference. However, if
                        your
                        number of features is very large (e.g. more than 100,000), you should consider using gradient
                        descent.
                        This is because the normal equation inverts \(X^{T}X\), which can be quite computationally expensive
                        with a large number of features.

                        In the following D3.js chart you can explore how a polynomial regression behaves. \(\theta_0\) and
                        \(\theta_1\) have the same behavior as above: they change the vertical positioning and slope of the
                        line. But what does \(\theta_2\) do? Find out by adjusting the sliders and creating new datasets.
                        Also
                        observe how the metrics change when you display the best fit.

                        First things first: we can see that the scatter plot has the shape of a parabola. This means that
                        unlike the
                        first D3.js chart, our dataset has a quadratic, rather than a linear relationship. \(\theta_2\)
                        pushes and pulls
                        the line inwards and outwards, respectively. For \(\theta_2=0\) we simply get a line. If we increase
                        the
                        absolute value of \(\theta_2\) the line turns into the shape of a parabola. Feel free to play around
                        with the
                        sliders, display the residuals and try to reduce them.

                        Polynomial features show how versatile linear regression models are, since small changes are already
                        enough to
                        create a whole new predictor. The calculation of the optimal model parameters is very similar to the
                        univariate
                        version and differs only by the additional model parameter \(\theta_2\) and the newly added

                        That's all I have to say about polynomial regressions. To be honest, it sounds a lot fancier than it
                        actually
                        is. Basically, you're just extending some existing features to make the model more flexible. Still,
                        I find it
                        fascinating that linear models can be used to explain quadratic or cubic relationships.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point, a somewhat naive but valid question would be: why don't we just keep adding
                        polynomial features
                        to our model until we have a perfect model? Couldn't we then explain every dataset perfectly? To
                        some extent,
                        this statement is true. By continuously adding polynomial features we are able to explain larger
                        parts of the
                        variance. This means that our prediction model gets better. Up until we are able to perfectly
                        reproduce the
                        dataset. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't help us much and is actually one of the best known
                        pitfalls in
                        machine learning.

                    <p>
                        Machine learning is full of tradeoffs, they are around every corner and you can hardly make a
                        decision without
                        balancing your options. Among all those tradeoffs, over-/underfitting is definitely one of the
                        best-known.
                        Despite that it still happens all the time 💩. For some reason overfitting is so obvious, yet so
                        tempting.

                        You can explore the topic yourself in the following D3.js chart. The left-hand slider changes the
                        degrees of
                        freedom of a polynomial regression, which is trained using the training dataset (scatter plot in the
                        left-hand
                        figure). Next, we use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset in the figure on the
                        right side.
                        You can adjust the dataset's underlying noise with the second slider. Play around with the settings
                        and observe
                        how the regression line behaves in both charts. The training and test metrics provide interesting
                        insights into
                        the cross-dataset performance of the model.

                    <p>
                        As mentioned earlier, linear regression is a high bias and low variance model. Simply put, linear
                        regression has
                        little flexibility since it assumes that the dataset can be explained linearly. Polynomial features
                        are a way to
                        reduce the bias of a linear regression model and at the same time increase its variance. In other
                        words, the
                        model becomes more flexible. Let's figure out what this looks like by changing the regression's
                        degrees of
                        freedom. Note: click on the hyperlinks in the text to see each scenario in the chart above.

                            href="#chart3"><code>degree = 1</code></a> we get a
                        straight line, which makes sense since this is just a linear regression. The train and test metrics
                        are quite
                        bad and fairly similar. Similarly bad metrics on both train and test are a good indication of
                        underfitting. Our
                        model is too simple, or in other words, we model both datasets equally poorly. This is obvious,
                        since we are
                        trying to approximate a quadratic scatterplot using a linear function. If we increase the degrees of
                        freedom to
                        <a class="chart3-options" id="chart3-degrees-2-noise-7" href="#chart3"><code>degree = 2</code></a>,
                        the model
                        performance improves dramatically — on both datasets!

                    <p>
                        Better metrics on train than test are generally a good thing. It speaks against underfitting,
                        however we cannot
                        exclude that our model is already overfitting. If we increase the degrees of freedom to <a

                            href="#chart3"><code>degree = 5</code></a> we see
                        minimal to no improvement in all metrics. This is a strong indication that we are close to
                        overfitting and will
                        only continue to make things worse. Let’s increase the degrees of freedom to <a
                            class="chart3-options" id="chart3-degrees-10-noise-7"
                            href="#chart3"><code>degree = 10</code></a> and observe what happens to the
                        performance metrics.

                    <p>
                        Surprise 🤡 our train metrics keep improving while we're continuing to mess up performance on test
                        set. That's
                        overfitting at its best. We can continue this effect by increasing the degrees of freedom to <a

                        training performance will continuously improve, while our predictions on unseen data will get even
                        worse.

                    <p>
                        But what about the noise slider? Noise adds another layer of complexity on top, since it amplifies
                        the just
                        explained problem of overfitting. For example, have a look at the following polynomial regression
                        with <a class="chart3-options" id="chart3-degrees-15-noise-0"
                            href="#chart3"><code>degree = 15</code> on a dataset
                            with <code>noise = 0</code></a>. This is a perfectly clean dataset without any variation or
                        noise, so
                        everything learned on train can be applied to test. That's the reason why there's no difference
                        between train
                        and test metrics, despite the high number of polynomial features. Let's keep the degrees of freedom
                        at <a class="chart3-options" id="chart3-degrees-15-noise-15"
                            href="#chart3"><code>degree = 15</code>, but work on
                            a dataset with <code>noise = 15</code></a> to see what impact underlying noise has on high
                        polynomial
                        regressions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As expected, there is a high discrepancy between our train and test metrics. The reason for this is
                        that high
                        degrees of freedom allow the polynomial regression to pick up the entire noise in the training
                        dataset. The
                        result is a model that's pretty good at resembling all the patterns and noise in the training data
                        but cannot
                        generalize to any unseen data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope this takes out the complexity of the entire over-/underfitting tradeoff. It's really not a
                        big deal and
                        not too hard to understand if you have some visual assistance. This concludes my take on linear
                        regression
                        models! There's one more thing I'd like to explain, since everything I've covered above is just one
                        part of what
                        linear models are capable of. All of the above can be used to train a model that predicts continous
                        values such
                        as stock prices, temperatures, country's GDPs or heights. These so-called regression problems are a
                        major part
                        of machine learning, however, not all tasks boil down to predicting a continous number. Just think
                        about
                        recommender systems, spam filters or detecting whether a picture includes a cat or a dog. Let's have
                        a look at
                        classification problems and how the so-called logistic function enables a simple linear regression
                        model to
                        predict probabilities.

                    <h1 class="section-heading">Logistic Regression</h1>
                    <p>
                        In contrast to a linear or polynomial regression, logistic regression doesn't predict a continous
                        value. The
                        goal is to predict a discrete value like whether or not an instance belongs to a certain class. This
                        is called
                        classification and, along with regression, is one of the most common tasks in machine learning. In
                        the
                        following, we explore a binary classification problem in greater detail. Binary classification
                        problems deal
                        with the question whether an instance belongs to a positive (1) or negative (0) class. For example,
                        a model that
                        predicts whether a flower is a sunflower (positive class, 1) or a rose (negative class 0).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Good news first: if you understand how linear regression works you're almost there. This is because
                        under the
                        hood logistic regression is also a linear model that makes a prediction based on the weighted sum of
                        some input
                        features (plus a bias term). The main difference is that the target variable we want to predict is
                        between 0 and
                        1. The reason for this is simply that we are predicting probabilities and since probabilities are
                        constrained to
                        be in the range of 0 to 1 any other values wouldn't really make sense. To achieve this, we simply
                        squeeze the
                        outputs of a linear regression into a corridor between zero and one by applying the logistic
                        function. The
                        logistic, often also referred to as sigmoid function, is defined as follows: $$ \sigma(t) =
                        \frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}
                        $$

                        \(\sigma(t)\) has a distinct S-shape and only outputs values between zero and one. This means that
                        \(\hat{y} =
                        \theta^{T}x\) becomes: $$ \hat{p} = \sigma(\theta^{T}x) $$ Determining whether an instance belongs
                        to the
                        positive or negative class is really easy just by looking at \(\hat{p}\): $$ \hat{y} = \begin{cases}
                        0 &
                        \text{if } \hat{p} &lt; 0.5 \\ 1 & \text{if } \hat{p} \geq 0.5 \end{cases} $$ Simple, right? The
                        final prediction
                        only depends on whether the probability \(\hat{p}\) is greater than or equal to 0.5. If \(\hat{p}\)
                        is
                        greater than or equal to 0.5 then \(\hat{y}=1\), otherwise \(\hat{y}=0\). </p>

                        As with linear regression, the perfect sigmoid curve can be found by minimizing a cost function
                        using
                        gradient descent. We could use the same cost function as before, however, generally speaking <a
                            href="https://i.imgur.com/GOhfk6k.png" target="_blank">one does not simply regress a binary
                            outcome
                            applying ordinary least squares</a>. The reason therefore is that weird things, such as
                        predicted
                        probabilities smaller or larger than zero and one, can happen when optimizing logistic regression
                        using
                        least squares. Let's think about the main objective of a classifier to get an idea of how a better
                        suited loss function could look like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simply put, everything a classification task is about is to express how close a classifier's output
                        is
                        to the correct output. We can achieve this by using a loss function that prefers the correct class
                        labels of the training examples to be more likely. This is also called maximum likelihood estimation
                        and
                        everything it does is to choose a set of model parameters that maximize the log probability of the
                        true
                        \(y\) labels in the training data given the observations \(X\). The resulting cost function is the
                        negative log likelihood, often also referred to as the cross-entropy loss:
                    </p>
                    <p style="overflow-x: auto;">
                        $$ -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}[y^{(i)}\log{(\hat{p}^{(i)})}+(1-y^{(i)})\log{(1-\hat{p}^{(i)})}] $$
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you can see, wrong predictions are penalized while correct ones are rewarded. This is because
                        \(y^{(i)}\log{(\hat{p}^{(i)})}\) is large (bad) if the instance belongs to the positive class, but
                        the
                        model predicts a low probability. Similarly, for instances belonging to the negative class,
                        \((1-y^{(i)})\log{(1-\hat{p}^{(i)})}\) becomes large (bad) if a high probability is predicted.
                        Unfortunately, there is no known closed-form equation for the above cost function, which means that
                        we
                        cannot determine the perfect model parameters like above when we used
                        \(\hat{\theta}=(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}y\). The good news is that the cost function is convex and gradient
                        descent is therefore guaranteed to reach the global minimum. Enough theory, let's construct a small
                        example to see how it works.

                        a
                        common and simple dataset for multi-class classification of iris species. The dataset contains three
                        different species of irises (setosa, versicolour, and virginica), as well as their petal and sepal
                        widths and lengths. Basically, it is a dataset of three flowers of the same species (labels) with
                        different measurements (features).

                        We'd like to keep things as simple as possible, which is why we restrict the problem to predicting a
                        single target with one feature. This allows me to plot the entire binary classification task in a
                        single
                        graph with the feature \(X\) on the horizontal axis, the target \(y\) on the vertical axis, and the
                        sigmoid decision boundary in the chart. Furthermore, I've implemented additional functionalities
                        that
                        allow you to train a classifier based on different target-feature combinations. For example, if you
                        select "petal width" and "virginica" in the dropdowns below, what happens under the hood is the
                        following:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">>>> X = X[["petal width (cm)"]]

>>> y.to_numpy()

                    <p>
                        Feel free to play around with the dropdown options and the model parameters in the following D3.js

                        selected target and feature values. Under the hood, clicking the "Converge" button starts gradient
                        descent in the background, which iteratively evaluates the gradient, combines it with a learning
                        rate
                        and updates the current values of \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\). In this case, gradient descent
                        stops
                        iterating as soon as the loss reduction drops below a certain tolerance, which I have set to

                        The continuously increasing blue sigmoid curve indicates the probability with which an instance
                        belongs to the
                        target class. The continuously decreasing red curve indicates the opposite, namely the probability
                        with which an
                        instance does not belong to the target class. This is really intuitive, since the red curve is
                        simply defined as
                        \(1 - \frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}\). The decision boundary is located at the intersection of the two curves.
                        Both model
                        parameters shift the decision boundary on the x-axis. While \(\theta_0\) shifts the whole sigmoid
                        curve to the
                        left and right, \(\theta_1\) changes the slope in the area of the decision boundary. Both parameters
                        push the
                        decision boundary to the right for small values and to the left for large values.

                        The scatter plot reflects the raw data's \(X\) and \(y\) values. A quick look at the y-axis reveals
                        that we're
                        dealing with a binary classification problem, since all the scatter points are either located at
                        \(y=0\) or
                        \(y=1\). Hence, a data point at \(y=0\) indicates that it <b>doesn't belong</b> to the target class,
                        while
                        \(y=1\) indicates that it <b>does belong</b> to the target class. The position on the x-axis simply
                        reflects the
                        data points feature value, e.g. the pedal width or sepal length in centimetres. A scatter point's
                        color
                        indicates if the model's prediction is correct (green) or wrong (red). As mentioned before, the
                        final prediction
                        depends on the probability \(\hat{p} = \sigma(\theta^{T}x)\) in the way that if \(\hat{p} \geq 0.5\)
                        the models
                        predicts \(\hat{y}=1\) and \(\hat{y}=0\) if \(\hat{p} &lt; 0.5\). Visually this corresponds to
                        projecting each data
                        point onto the blue sigmoid curve and evaluating the corresponding \(y\) value. Give it a try! I've
                        implemented a tool tip in the chart above so you can actually see the projection and get a feeling
                        for the
                        model's predicted probabilities. Simply hover over any of the red and green scatter points to
                        activate the
                        tooltip. </p>
                    <p>
                        The nice thing about binary classification problems is that the model's predictions can be assigned
                        to
                        one of four different buckets:

                        <li>
                            Correctly classifying a positive target. In the chart above this corresponds to a green dot at
                            \(y=1\). The prediction is correct since the point's projection on the blue sigmoid curve is
                            greater
                            equal than \(0.5\). This is also known as a true positive.

                            than
                            \(0.5\). This is also known as a false negative.

                        Probably you've already recognized that some target-feature combinations are easier to separate than
                        others. For example, training a versicolor classifier based on the flower's petal widths results in
                        a
                        really weird, almost linear, sigmoid shape. The resulting classifier predicts zero for all data
                        points.
                        This might look wrong, however, in that case these are just the best model parameters to separate
                        all
                        the ones from the zeroes. Other combinations, such as petal width as the feature and virginica as
                        the
                        target, are easier to separate and result in a more visually appealing sigmoid shape. This is, once
                        again, a reminder that you must be really careful about imbalanced datasets, the right choice of
                        your
                        loss function, and choosing an appropriate learning algorithm for the underlying task.
